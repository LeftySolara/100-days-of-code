# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Julianne Adams

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on August 4, Sunday, 2024.

## Goal

My goal for this challenge is to learn to program in Go.

## Log

### R1D1

Started working on my first Go project: a basic calculator with a GUI.
Learned some things about Go syntax and started learning how to use the
[GioUI](https://gioui.org/doc/learn/get-started) library. So far I've been able
to create a window, display a button, and align the button in the window.

### R1D2

Worked on simplifying the code for the calculator project.
The existing code was too complex and confusing for someone
unfamiliar with Golang (me), so I made it a bit more tidy.

### R1D3

Learned about variadic functions and figured out how to display multiple
buttons without having to declare and draw each individual one separately.

### R1D4

Learned about pointers in Go. Also figured out how to make buttons clickable
in the calculator project.

### R1D5

Learned about structs in Go.

For the calculator project, I've migrated from GioUI to Wails. I was having a lot
of trouble with Gio, but I feel like Wails will be easier since I'm already familiar
with React and TypeScript.
