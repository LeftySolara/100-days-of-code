## Log

### R1D1

Started working on my first Go project: a basic calculator with a GUI.
Learned some things about Go syntax and started learning how to use the
[GioUI](https://gioui.org/doc/learn/get-started) library. So far I've been able
to create a window, display a button, and align the button in the window.
